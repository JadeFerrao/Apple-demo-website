Comfort
<br>
<br>
<center>Arrival of the fittest.
<br>
<br>
We refined the details of comfort, creating a new class of in-ear headphones with a customisable fit that forms an exceptional seal for Active Noise Cancellation. 
You’ll feel your music, not your headphones.
Choose from three sizes of soft, flexible silicone tips that click into place. Find the best fit — and get the best sound — by using the Ear Tip Fit Test.
<br>
These internally tapered tips conform to your ear shape, keeping AirPods Pro secure. And with vents helping equalise pressure, you feel like there’s nothing in your ears.

<br>
<br>
Sound that cuts out the noise.
AirPods Pro are the only in-ear headphones with Active Noise Cancellation that continuously adapts to the geometry of your ear and the fit of the ear tips — blocking out the world so you can focus on what you’re listening to.<br>

<br>
An outward-facing microphone detects external sound.
<br>
AirPods Pro then counter it with equal anti-noise, cancelling the external sound before you hear it.
<br>
An inward-facing microphone listens inside your ear for unwanted sound, which is also eliminated with anti-noise.
<br>
Noise cancellation is continuously adjusted at 200 times per second for truly immersive sound, so you’re fully tuned in to your music, podcasts and calls.
<br>
Want to hear what’s happening around you? Just press and hold the force sensor on the stem to jump between Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode — which lets outside sound in, and allows things to sound and feel natural when you’re talking to people nearby.
<br>
<br>
Audio quality
<br>
<br>
Everything you hear is unheard of.
Enjoy superior sound quality with Adaptive Equaliser, which automatically tunes music to the shape of your ear for a rich, consistent listening experience.
<br>
An inward-facing microphone hears sound as you do. AirPods Pro then fine-tune the audio by adjusting the mid and low frequencies.
<br>
Powerful bass is delivered by a custom-built high-excursion, low-distortion speaker driver.
