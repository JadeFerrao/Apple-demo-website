<br>
<br>
HomePod mini packs a punch.
<br>
<br>
Room-filling sound.
<br>
An intelligent assistant.
<br>
Control your smart home.
<br>
Private and secure.
<br>
<br>
Jam-packed with innovation, HomePod mini delivers unexpectedly big sound for a speaker of its size. At just over 8 centimetres tall, it takes up almost no space but fills the entire room with rich 360-degree audio that sounds amazing from every angle.
<br>
HomePod mini is designed to fit anywhere in the house. Its elegant shape is wrapped in a perfectly seamless mesh fabric that’s virtually transparent to the sound passing through it. A backlit touch surface on the top provides quick control.
<br>
<br>
With multiple HomePod mini speakers placed around the house, you can have a connected sound system for your whole home.1 Ask Siri to play one song everywhere or, just as easily, a different song in each room. And HomePod mini works with HomePod for multi-room audio and features like Intercom.
<br>
<br>
<h1>Intercom spreads the word.</h1>
<br>
With more than one HomePod in the house, you can easily communicate with your family members by voice using Intercom. Ask Siri to send your message to the whole house or to individual rooms — and everyone can easily respond.
<br>
<br>
The Apple-designed high-excursion woofer is positioned at the top of the speaker facing upwards, 
creating a wide range of deep bass that surpasses any traditional speaker. A six-microphone array, along with an internal bass-EQ microphone, 
analyses and compensates for the effect of the room on the bass response, providing rich, consistent sound. And a powerful motor drives the diaphragm a remarkable 20 millimetres, 
so the bass shines through even when the volume is low.
