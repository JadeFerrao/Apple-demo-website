<br>
Four million pixels.
<br>
One immersive experience.
<br>
<br>
With a resolution of 2560x1600 for over 4 million pixels, the results are positively jaw dropping. 
Images take on a new level of detail and realism. Text is sharp and clear. 
And True Tone technology automatically adjusts the white point of the display to match the colour temperature of your environment — making web pages and email look as natural as the printed page. With millions of colours, everything you see is rich and vibrant. 
The display glass goes right to the edge of the enclosure, so you can focus on what’s on your screen. And you’re going to love what you see.
